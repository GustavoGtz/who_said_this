'Who Said This?' is the name of this small game
project inspired by Kahoot [https://kahoot.it].

The project is a web-based game where you can upload
your friends' chat history, process it, and obtain a
list of potential messages. Finally, you play a trivia
game with them, trying to guess who was the person
who wrote the message shown on the screen.

It is composed of a Python backend where all the
procedures related to processing the chat take place,
and a frontend/backend that works as the web application,
with responsive views for desktop (host) and mobile
(players), implemented using WebSockets.

If you want to know more details about the specific
implementation, you can read the README files inside
the backend and frontend folders.

-------------------------------------------------

This work is only a POC (Proof Of Concept) implemented
specifically for WhatsApp, but it can be adapted to work
with many other chat histories, and you are free to
implement your own version.

And if it is not obvious, it probably contains many
bugs and issues. I will try to fix them over time, and
if you want to contribute, feel free to submit a pull
request.

Also, the UI is very simple and could be improved.

Specifically, you could modify the READER to support
other platforms such as Facebook or Telegram.
