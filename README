'Who Said This?' is the name of this small game 
project inspired by Kahoot[https://kahoot.it].

The project is a web-based game where you can upload 
your friend's chat history to process it and get a 
list of potential messages, and finally play a trivia 
game with them trying to guess who was the person
that wrote the message shown on the screen.

It is composed of a Python backend where all the 
procedures related to processing the chat take place, 
and a front/back end that works as the web application, 
with responsive views for desktop (host) and mobile 
(players), implemented using WebSockets.

-------------------------------------------------

If you only want to play with your friends, here is a 
little tutorial to set all this up (note that this 
implementation is only viable on a local host, so make 
sure all your friends are on the same network when you 
play):

-------------------------------------------------

This work is only a POC (Proof Of Concept) implemented 
with the specific case of WhatsApp, but it can be used 
with many other chat histories besides this one, and 
you are free to implement your own version.
